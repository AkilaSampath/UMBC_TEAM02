We should be able to output the data for problem 2 using function 1 in the format:

wavelength    radiance
...           ...
...           ...
...           ...
wavelength    radiance

One temperature in each file, so we will have sun.dat and earth.dat.

Then gnuplot can graph both. I will make a gnuplot file to run.

run the gnuplot script using:
gnuplot plot.gnp
